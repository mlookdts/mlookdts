## I. Overview

The **MLOOK Document Tracking System (DTS)** is a class project that demonstrates how to streamline document management by centralizing creation, routing, approval, and archival processes within a secure web application built on Laravel 12. The system uses DMMMSU-MLUC as an example organization, with access restricted to users with valid DMMMSU email accounts (@student.dmmmsu.edu.ph and @dmmmsu.edu.ph) to showcase authentication and authorization features.

Through DTS, users are able to:

- Create and upload digital documents with metadata
- Route documents through multi-level approval workflows
- Track document location and status in real-time
- Receive instant notifications via WebSocket technology
- Sign documents electronically with QR code verification
- Generate comprehensive analytics and reports
- Maintain complete audit trails for compliance

This solves common manual workflow issues, including:

- Lost or misplaced paper files
- Delays in routing and approval processes
- Lack of status transparency and accountability
- Difficulty retrieving archived documents
- Inefficient communication between departments
- Missing audit trails for compliance requirements

The system benefits organizations handling:

- Academic documents and administrative workflows
- Sensitive information requiring secure handling
- Multi-department approval processes
- Workflows requiring complete accountability and traceability
- High-volume document processing

By recording timestamps, actions, and maintaining version history, the system ensures traceability, compliance, and informed decision-making across the organization.

## IV. Installation Guide

This section provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the MLOOK Document Tracking System on your local or production environment.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning installation, ensure the following software is installed:

- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer 2.x
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- MySQL 8.0 or higher
- Git version control
- Web server (Apache or Nginx)
- Redis (optional, recommended for production)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd mlook-dts-main
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment

Create and configure the environment file (the Composer setup script will create one from `.env.example` if it doesn't exist):

```bash
# Create your environment file if it doesn't exist yet
# If .env.example is unavailable, create .env manually
copy .env.example .env  # Windows (PowerShell: Copy-Item .env.example .env)
# or: cp .env.example .env  # macOS/Linux

# If no example file is present, create an empty one:
# Windows: New-Item .env -ItemType File
# macOS/Linux: touch .env

# Generate application encryption key
php artisan key:generate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Run the following commands in order:

```bash
composer install
npm install
php artisan migrate
php artisan reverb:start
php artisan db:seed
```

Run `php artisan reverb:start` in a separate terminal so the WebSocket server keeps running.

### Step 4: Database Configuration

Edit the `.env` file and configure your database connection:

```env
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=db_dts
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
```

Create the database:

```bash
mysql -u root -p
CREATE DATABASE db_dts;
exit;
```

If you need to reset the database entirely, you can instead run:

```bash
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

### Step 5: Additional Configuration

Configure additional services in the `.env` file:

**Mail Configuration (Required for email verification):**

For Gmail:
```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your-email@gmail.com
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

**Important:** For Gmail, you must use an App Password, not your regular password. Generate one at: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

**WebSocket Configuration (Laravel Reverb):**
```env
REVERB_APP_ID=your-app-id
REVERB_APP_KEY=your-app-key
REVERB_APP_SECRET=your-app-secret
REVERB_HOST=127.0.0.1
REVERB_PORT=8080
REVERB_SCHEME=http
```

**Cache and Queue Configuration:**
```env
CACHE_STORE=database
QUEUE_CONNECTION=database
```

### Step 6: Storage Setup

Create the symbolic link for file storage:

```bash
php artisan storage:link
```

Set appropriate permissions (Linux/Mac):

```bash
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
```

### Step 7: Build Frontend Assets

Compile frontend assets using Vite:

```bash
# For development
npm run dev

# For production
npm run build
```

### Step 8: Running the Application

**Quick Start (Development Mode):**

Run all services concurrently with a single command:

```bash
composer dev
```

This starts:
- PHP development server (http://localhost:8000)
- Queue worker for background jobs
- Laravel Pail for log monitoring
- Vite development server for hot module replacement

**Manual Start (Alternative):**

Start each service in separate terminal windows:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Laravel development server
php artisan serve

# Terminal 2: Queue worker
php artisan queue:work

# Terminal 3: WebSocket server
php artisan reverb:start

# Terminal 4: Vite development server
npm run dev
```

### Default User Accounts

After seeding, the following accounts are available:

**Seeded Test Accounts (email patterns):**
- Admins: `admin1@dmmmsu.edu.ph`, `admin2@dmmmsu.edu.ph`
- Registrars: `registrar1@dmmmsu.edu.ph`, `registrar2@dmmmsu.edu.ph`
- Deans: `{college_code}.dean@dmmmsu.edu.ph` (e.g., `cics.dean@dmmmsu.edu.ph`)
- Department Heads: `{dept_code}.head@dmmmsu.edu.ph` (e.g., `reg.head@dmmmsu.edu.ph`)
- Faculty: `{firstname}.{lastname}{nn}@dmmmsu.edu.ph`
- Staff: `{firstname}.{lastname}{nn}@dmmmsu.edu.ph`
- Students: `{firstname}.{lastname}{nn}@student.dmmmsu.edu.ph`

Password for all seeded accounts: `password`

- Keep backup copies off-site

### 12. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues and Solutions:**

**Queue Not Processing:**
```bash
php artisan queue:restart
php artisan queue:work
```

**WebSocket Connection Failed:**
- Verify Reverb server is running: `php artisan reverb:start`
- Check REVERB_* configuration in `.env`
- Ensure firewall allows port 8080
- Verify WebSocket URL in frontend configuration

**Email Not Sending:**
- Verify MAIL_* configuration in `.env`
- For Gmail, use App Password instead of regular password
- Check queue worker is running
- Review mail logs for errors

**Permission Errors:**
```bash
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
chown -R www-data:www-data storage bootstrap/cache
```

**Performance Issues:**
- Enable Redis for caching and queues
- Optimize database with proper indexing
- Review slow query logs
- Enable production mode caching
- Use CDN for static assets

## VIII. Technical Documentation

### API Documentation

This project primarily exposes web routes and internal dashboard APIs (e.g., `routes/web.php`, `/dashboard/api/*`) used by the application UI. There is no `/api/v1/*` namespace in this repository.

If you need programmatic access, you can:
- Use the existing dashboard endpoints under `/dashboard/api/*` where applicable; or
- Add dedicated API routes under `routes/api.php` and protect them with Sanctum.

Optional: To create a Sanctum token for custom endpoints you add:

```bash
php artisan tinker
$user = \App\Models\User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('api-token')->plainTextToken;
```

### Testing

**Running Tests:**

```bash
# Run all tests
composer test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test --filter=DocumentTest

# Run with coverage report
php artisan test --coverage
```

### Code Quality

**Code Style (Laravel Pint):**

```bash
composer pint
```

**Static Analysis (optional):**

```bash
composer require --dev phpstan/phpstan
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse
```
